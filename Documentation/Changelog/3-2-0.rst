3.2.0 - 2015/03/XX
------------------

Shortly after the release of 3.1.0 I have been motivated to get some nice new features ready!

Upgrade procedure
=================

The following changes might break your installation but all are easy to solve.

Usage of namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The extension uses now fully namespaces which meant touching every PHP class at least once!
The used vendor name is **GeorgRinger**!

Dropping the mm table for tt_content relations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
	This is only relevant if you use the flag **Use content element relation** which needs to be set
	in the configuration inside the *Extension Manager*.

Previously, tt_content elements have been added by using the mm relation table ```tx_news_domain_model_news_ttcontent_mm``` which had some drawbacks.
The usage of this table is now dropped which means that after updating, you need to run the Update Wizard in the *Install Tool* to migrate the relations.

The Upgrade Wizard is called **EXT:news Migrate from tt_content mm relation**.

Important changes
=================

A lot of code changed in this version. The most important changes are:

* Fo
* Bar
